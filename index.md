Welcome! I am a Lecturer in Economics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/economics/). My research is in the field of labor economics, discrimination and migration. I use theoretical modeling and modern data analysis to understand how social inequality generated and reproduced.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research](http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/economics/).
