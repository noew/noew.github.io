I am a Senior Lecturer in Economics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/economics/), and a Research Associate at the [Political Economy Research Institute](https://www.peri.umass.edu/).

My research interests are in political economy, in particular around issues of labor, inequality and discrimination. I use theoretical modeling and modern data analysis to understand how inequality is reproduced and shaped by power relations in the context of a complex, interdependent society.
