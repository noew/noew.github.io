I am a Lecturer in Economics at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](http://www.umass.edu/economics/). My current research is in the political economy of labor, in particular around issues of social discrimination, inequality and migration. I use theoretical modeling and modern data analysis to understand how inequality is reproduced and shaped by power relations in society.

I hold a Ph.D. in Economics from the [New School for Social Research](http://www.newschool.edu/nssr/economics/), and a BA in Socioeconomics from the [University of Geneva](https://www.unige.ch/).
