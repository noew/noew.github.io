Welcome to my webpage! I am an economist working on migration, income inequality and the dynamics of labor markets.

I am a Lecturer in Economics at the <a href="http://www.umass.edu/economics/">University of Massachusetts Amherst</a>. My research is in the fields of labor economics and income inequality. I use both theoretical modeling and modern data analysis to understand how complex social phenomena can arise from the interaction of a large number of firms and workers in a capitalist economy. You can find out more about my [research]({{ site.baseurl }}/research) and [teaching]({{ site.baseurl }}/teaching).
