My goal is for students to be able to look at real-world economic issues from different angles, to understand and critically evaluate the different theoretical perspectives that influence very concrete policy decisions, and to feel empowered to participate in the political-economic debate.

In my classes on quantitative research methods, I teach modern techniques of statistical inference and data analysis, emphasizing simulation, data visualization and reproducibility.

My teaching fields include [labor economics](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/ESnPVtLRV2lAmUtKj3LoyIcBb4cJeTmpUMQKwa3ImDN6sA?e=KaatSv), [inequality](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/EQiFgxPvQCJGlBSe8N-P87gBrQ-HOelBWPO6Pzz559BvQQ?e=BfLpfD), [microeconomics](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/EWJL8JmswypNgUbu4Y7lu9wBZTJuC8crf7Mlo_Ycq4ap-A?e=zYTvwj), and [econometrics](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/EaLnHj2MpZpPt2QsIG7QW74BcUxMhsPqdQyiWXN-mUcnww?e=4megrG).
