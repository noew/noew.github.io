My goal is for students to be able to look at real-world economic issues from different angles, to understand and critically evaluate the different theoretical perspectives that influence very concrete policy decisions, and to feel empowered to participate in the political-economic debate.

In my classes on quantitative research methods, I teach modern techniques of statistical inference and data analysis, emphasizing simulation, data visualization and reproducibility.

My teaching fields include microeconomics (for syllabi, see [1](http://umass.box.com/v/econ103h-syllabus), [2]({{ site.baseurl }}/lecobehav.pdf)), labor economics ([1](https://umass.box.com/v/labor-330)) and quantitative methods ([1](https://umass.box.com/v/syllabus-econ452)).
