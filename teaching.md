My goal is for students to be able to look at real-world economic issues from different angles, to understand and critically evaluate the different theoretical perspectives that influence very concrete policy decisions, and to feel empowered to participate in the political-economic debate.

In my classes on quantitative research methods, I teach modern techniques of statistical inference and data analysis, emphasizing simulation, data visualization and reproducibility.

My teaching fields include [labor economics](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/EXdvxgZksfNApwbgBKuj09wBID7445r3je5S8qtn34JGuQ?e=NCrYiQ) and [econometrics](https://umass-my.sharepoint.com/:b:/g/personal/nwiener_umass_edu/EYM4k8KtfaxPpedYq_622PkBFqywKwrXLBkKNR9jvsjSvQ?e=bjbo9h).
